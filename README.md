# Non-Contact Tactile Perception for Hybrid-Active Gripper

This work presents a novel approach to object recognition using a reconfigurable gripper with multiple Time of Flight (ToF) sensors attached to in fingers and palm, introducing the concept of  Non-Contact Tactile Perception. The approach aims to promote the proprioceptive sense in the gripper workspace allowing the object prediction to manipulation tasks.

The Hybrid-Active (H-A) Gripper can adapt its topology to achieve an optimal pick-up and gripping over different objects, which requires a reliable object estimation. The Non-Contact Tactile Perception uses the ToF sensors and the gripper reconfiguration degrees-of-freedom for the 3D perception and surface estimation of pick-up object. The gripper is an active agent in the manipulation system because when the object is recognized by it, the gripper becomes the master assigning commands and goals to the manipulator. The method is based on five ToF sensors in the palm that identify the distance and adjust the gripper to the object's center through its capability of managing the manipulator.

The H-A Gripper also has twelve sensors distributed over its three fingers: four sensors on each finger, two on the distal phalanx, and two on the middle phalanx. Fingers have rotational mobility of 180ยบ, allowing sensing of all faces of the object and at different angles to the tridimensional reconstruction. 
The proposed approach is evaluated in four experiments that analyze the influence of resolution, object complexity, finger tilt, and angular sampling over eleven objects with different complexities. The experimentation set allows the overall evaluation of Non-Contact Tactile Perception and the specification of its performance parameters.

## Instructions

These instructions can be used for the reconstruction of the project and analysis of its results.

All the tests was processing on Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic 1.14.13, and MATLAB R2022a. The ROS was used to integrate the Arduino with MATLAB.

### 1 - H-A Grippers' project

This gripper is a project developed with affordable electronic devices and structural parts printed in PLA from 3D printers. The H-A Gripper uses seventten sensors VL53L0X for detecting and scanning the objects, nine servo motors MG996R for controlling the all moves of the gripper, and one microcontroller Arduino MEGA to work.

The project is in the past xxxx.

### 2 - How scan the objects

The files to realize this step are in the past xxxx. The arduino needs have 

1 - Connecting the arduino with rosserial. In doubt visit this link.
2 - Open the file xxxx in the MATLAB. This fil
